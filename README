 Introduction

This EEG dataset contains the electrophysiological signal from sixty-two obese and non-obese preteens 
during a delayed-verification math task. The stimuli were designed and administered using E-Prime 
software (Version 2) at Arkansas Children Nutrition Center (ACNC), Little Rock, Arkansas.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) approved the study protocol. This research
was supported by USDA/Agricultural Research Service Project 6026-51000-012-06S.

 Raw data files

The data was acquired with a Geodesic Net Amps 300 system running Netstation 4.5.2 software using 
the 128-channel Geodesic Hydrocell Sensor Netâ„¢ (Magstim EGI., Eugene OR, USA).
No operations have been performed on the data.

Participant data

The *Participants.tsv* file contains age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and performance.
