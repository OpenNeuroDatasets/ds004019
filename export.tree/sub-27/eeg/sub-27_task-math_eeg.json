  "TaskName": "Math task",
  "TaskDescription": "Subjects see two operands which were randomized addition and subtraction operation, then they see the three possible answers. All visual stimuli were black and presented centrally on a white background (Arial, 24 points). Each trial began with a blank screen displayed for 100 ms, presentation of arithmetic problems (e.g., 5 + 4) for 300 ms, followed by a blank screen for 1200 ms. Three possible answers were then presented on the screen,(e.g., a) 11 b) 9 c) 7) for 400 ms, with the correct answer to the presented problem always included in the choices. Upon choice presentation, participants were given a response interval of 1400 ms, and if no choice was selected in this time, no response was recorded. Participants were asked to press the key corresponding to their chosen answer with the first three fingers of their right hand",
    "Instructions": "Participants were instructed to calculate and select the correct response for each arithmetical operation, they also were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible",
